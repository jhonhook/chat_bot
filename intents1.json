The law of supply states that, all else being equal, as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity supplied by producers increases, and vice versa. Conversely, the law of demand states that, all else being equal, as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity demanded by consumers decreases, and vice versa. The interaction of supply and demand in a market determines the equilibrium price and quantity, where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. Changes in supply or demand, as well as other factors such as changes in production costs or consumer preferences, can lead to shifts in the supply and demand curves, resulting in changes in equilibrium price and quantity."

In other words, it represents the benefits that could have been gained from choosing the next best alternative instead of the one actually chosen. Opportunity cost arises because resources such as time, money, and effort are scarce and must be allocated among competing uses. By considering opportunity cost, individuals, businesses, and governments can make more informed decisions about how to allocate their resources efficiently and effectively. For example, if you choose to spend your evening studying for an exam rather than going out with friends, the opportunity cost of studying is the enjoyment and social interaction you would have experienced if you had chosen to go out."

It is typically measured as a percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or the Producer Price Index (PPI), which track the prices of a basket of goods and services consumed by households or produced by businesses, respectively. Inflation erodes the purchasing power of money, meaning that the same amount of money buys fewer goods and services over time. Moderate inflation is considered normal and may reflect healthy economic growth, while high or hyperinflation can have adverse effects on an economy, such as reducing consumer purchasing power, distorting price signals, and undermining confidence in the currency. Central banks often use monetary policy tools, such as adjusting interest rates or controlling the money supply, to manage inflation and maintain price stability."

GDP can be calculated using three different approaches: the production approach, which measures the value of all goods and services produced; the expenditure approach, which measures the total spending on goods and services by households, businesses, and the government; and the income approach, which measures the total income earned by individuals and businesses in the economy.

The unemployment rate provides insights into the health of the labor market and the overall economy. A low unemployment rate typically indicates a healthy labor market with a high level of employment opportunities, while a high unemployment rate may signal economic distress, such as a recession or sluggish growth. However, it's essential to consider other factors such as the labor force participation rate and the types of employment (e.g., full-time vs. part-time, temporary vs. permanent) when interpreting the unemployment rate."

There are two main components of fiscal policy: taxation and government spending. Expansionary fiscal policy involves lowering taxes and/or increasing government spending to stimulate economic activity during periods of recession or slow growth. In contrast, contractionary fiscal policy involves raising taxes and/or reducing government spending to cool down an overheated economy and control inflation. Fiscal policy decisions are typically made by governments through the budgetary process, where they set tax rates, allocate spending, and determine the size of the deficit or surplus."

Investors buy stocks in the hope that their value will increase over time, allowing them to profit from capital appreciation and dividends. Conversely, sellers sell stocks to realize gains or cut losses.\nStocks represent ownership stakes in companies, entitling shareholders to a portion of the company's assets and earnings, as well as voting rights in corporate decisions. Stock prices fluctuate based on various factors, including company performance, economic conditions, industry trends, investor sentiment, and geopolitical events.\nThe stock market plays a crucial role in the economy by facilitating capital formation, enabling companies to raise funds for growth and expansion, providing liquidity for investors to buy and sell securities, and serving as a barometer of economic health and investor confidence."
